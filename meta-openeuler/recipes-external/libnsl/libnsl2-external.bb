SUMMARY = "Library containing NIS functions using TI-RPC (IPv6 enabled)"
DESCRIPTION = "This library contains the public client interface for NIS(YP) and NIS+ \
               it was part of glibc and now is standalone packages. it also supports IPv6. \
               This recipe should work for extracting either the glibc or standalone libnsl \
               from the external toolchain."

# although external toolchain may provide libnsl2, it just includes .so only,
# no dev related files, e.g., .a, .h. So better to use the libnsl2_git.bb which
# provides more details. To avoid the note warning msg "multi providers of libnsl2"
# change PN = libnsl2-openeuler-external. If possible, use the libnsl2 in the prebuilt
# toolchain after necessary optimization.
